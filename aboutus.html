	Saul's Subs was started by our founder Saul Goodman. As a boy, he was very creative, loved watching movies and tv shows. At the age of 18, he went to Western Illinois University and studied buissness. He was a young entrepreneur and wanted to open up his own establishment. Growing up in Chicago, he grew up eating sub sandwitches. He made it a mission to find the best sub and tried all sorts of types, always trying a new type of sub every time he traveled. <br><br>

 One of his critisisms was that each sub place had their own type of sandwitch. If you ever had a taste for a different style of sub, youd have to order from a different place. Those different places can become very expensive, and what would happen if you wanted more then one type of pizza at a time? Matt decided to open up his own place.<br><br>

	He was inspired by classic Italian pizza parlors, the design of the place is a brick building with a massive interior canvas for familys to come and enjoy everything sandwitch! Not only did he work to provide the most variety of sub that any restaraunt has ever provided, but also to provide them as a cheap affordable option. Soon, we plan on making this a franchise. So far it is just one large establishment, but by the end of next year we hope to begin our expansion throughout the Chicagoland area and soon across the country. Bringing his high quality sub throughout the whole country. <br>
