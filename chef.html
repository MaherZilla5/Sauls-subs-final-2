<p>Our top sub maker is Chef Matt. Matt works at our downtown Chicago location which is our five star restaraunt as opposed to our normal chain that you will find all over the country. He was one of the founders at Saul's subs along with our founder Saul Goodman. He was he brought a cullinary art to his sandwitches that attracted a lot of people to the original locations all those years ago. He completed a bachelors of culinary arts at Harvard University in 2011 and after bouncing around some highly esteemed restaraunt venues, he came into working with Saul. Currently he is at the downtown location because of his extensive culinary skills go into our exclusive items there, along with being the head of cooking for all of Saul's Subs.  </p>
